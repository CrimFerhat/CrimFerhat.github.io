description: My research interests are both adult and child victims of crime, multiple-victimisation/poly-victimisation, correlates of victimisation and offending, the crime drop/crime trends, proactive policing styles (particularly problem-oriented policing), and the interaction/intersection of all the above. I am also interested in intersectional inequalities in victimisation and offending. I am currently working on an externally funded project that looks at the relationship between betting shops and crime in England and Wales. I use quantitative analysis methods (e.g., multilevel modelling) to conduct my research. I welcome PhD students who are interested in similar areas.
